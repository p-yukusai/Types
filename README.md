# Types
Fork of the Types application by [ystr](https://ystr.github.io/types/)
I'm unsure about the naming of this fork, so for now it'll stay as is.

The original app's development seems to be rather dead, this is an attempt to, if not revive it, at least make the source easily accessible for everyone.
An attempt is currently being made to port development to Visual Studio 2022, e.t.a is nonexistant ;)

# Planned features
- A dark theme (obviously ðŸ˜„)
- Easier localization management
- Auto-updates
- Theming
- Support for Win 8 and higher (though the app already works well enough for those versions of Windows)
- Bugfixes
- (Hopefully) Performance upgrades

# PR's
Push requests are encouraged and will be reviewed and perhaps merged!

# File structure
Still working on it ;)
